# Flyte SDK: Python Path Deployment Pattern

This example demonstrates how to use `flyte.init` with the `root_dir` parameter when your Flyte workflows import modules
from different directories. This is a pattern (though not recommended) when you have a project structure where workflow
definitions are separated from your business logic modules.

## Project Structure

```
pythonpath/
├── workflows/
│   └── workflow.py      # Flyte workflow definition
├── src/
│   └── my_module.py     # Business logic module
├── run.sh               # Execute workflow from project root
└── run_inside_folder.sh # Execute workflow from workflows/ directory
```

## The Problem

When your Flyte workflow (`workflows/workflow.py`) imports modules from other directories (`src/my_module.py`), the
Flyte SDK needs to understand the project's root directory to properly:

1. **Local execution**: Resolve imports during local development and testing
2. **Runtime packaging**: Package all necessary files for remote execution

Without specifying `root_dir`, Flyte would only package files relative to the workflow's directory, missing your
imported modules.

## The Solution: Using `root_dir`

In `workflows/workflow.py`, we specify the `root_dir` parameter:

```python
import pathlib
import flyte
from src.my_module import say_hello

if __name__ == "__main__":
    current_dir = pathlib.Path(__file__).parent
    config_path = current_dir / "../../../../config.yaml"
    # Set root_dir to the parent directory (project root)
    flyte.init_from_config(str(config_path), root_dir=current_dir.parent)
    r = flyte.run(greet, name="World")
    print(r.url)
```

### Key Points:

- **`root_dir=current_dir.parent`**: Sets the project root as the base directory
- **Import resolution**: The `from src.my_module import say_hello` import works because Flyte can now resolve the full
  project structure
- **File packaging**: Flyte will traverse and package files starting from `root_dir`, ensuring both `workflows/` and
  `src/` directories are included

## How It Works

1. **Local Development**: The `root_dir` parameter tells Flyte where to start looking for files and how to resolve
   relative imports
2. **Remote Execution**: When packaging your code for remote execution, Flyte uses `root_dir` as the base directory to
   collect all necessary files
3. **Import Context**: The runtime environment recreates the same directory structure, allowing imports to work
   correctly

## Testing This Example

This example includes two test scripts to verify that both execution methods work correctly:

### 1. Execute from Project Root

```bash
./run.sh
```

This script:

- Sets `PYTHONPATH` to the current directory (project root)
- Runs the workflow from the project root
- Verifies that files from both `workflows/` and `src/` are packaged

### 2. Execute from Workflows Directory

```bash
./run_inside_folder.sh
```

This script:

- Changes to the `workflows/` directory
- Sets `PYTHONPATH` to the project root
- Runs the workflow from within the workflows directory
- Demonstrates that `root_dir` works regardless of execution location

### Expected Behavior

Both scripts should:

1. Successfully execute the workflow locally
2. Package and upload files from both `workflows/` and `src/` directories
3. Return a workflow execution URL
4. Show in the logs that files from multiple directories were included in the package

You can verify successful packaging by checking the Flyte execution logs, which should show files from both directories
being copied to the remote execution environment.

## Best Practices

1. **Always set `root_dir`** when your workflows import from multiple directories, not in the current parent subtree
2. **Use pathlib** for cross-platform path handling
3. **Set `root_dir` to your project root** to ensure all dependencies are captured
4. **Test both execution patterns** to ensure your deployment works from any directory

## Common Pitfalls

- **Forgetting `root_dir`**: Results in import errors during remote execution
- **Wrong `root_dir` path**: May package too many or too few files
- **Relative import issues**: Not setting PYTHONPATH correctly for local testing

This pattern is an escape hatch for larger Flyte projects where code organization requires separating workflows from
business logic modules. Ideally, you should structure the project with pyproject.toml or setup.py to manage dependencies
and imports more cleanly, but this pattern provides a way to work with existing structures.
