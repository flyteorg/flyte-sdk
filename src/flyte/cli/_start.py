    Launch TUI explore mode to browse past local runs. To use the TUI install `pip install flyte[tui]`
    TUI, allows you to explore all your local runs if you have persistence enabled.

    Persistence can be enabled in 2 ways,
    1. By setting it in the config to record every local run
    ```bash
    flyte create config --endpoint ...  --local-persistence
    ```
    2. By passing it in flyte.init(local_persistence=True)
    This will record all `flyte.run` runs, that are local and are within the flyte.init being active.
